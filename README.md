A documentation of the code base used in:
Kemp, C., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2008). The Discovery of Structural Form. PNAS.

This was done as an exercise to better comprehend the code used in the paper, because I found the paper interesting and wanted a better understanding of the algorithms used.
Originally was a translation, but I decided against it because I realized it wasn't improving my understanding.

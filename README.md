A translation (from MATLAB to Python) of the code base used in The Discovery of Structural Form (https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/31/10687.full.pdf).

This was done as an exercise to better comprehend the code used in the paper, because I found the paper interesting and wanted a better understanding of the algorithms used.

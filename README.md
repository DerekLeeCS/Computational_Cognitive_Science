A translation (from MATLAB to Python) of the code base used in:
Kemp, C., &  Tenenbaum, J. B. (2008). The Discovery of Structural Form. PNAS. 
https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/31/10687.full.pdf

This was done as an exercise to better comprehend the code used in the paper, because I found the paper interesting and wanted a better understanding of the algorithms used.

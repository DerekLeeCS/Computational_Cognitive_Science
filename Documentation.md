# Terms
A form is a high-level type of structure. Examples given in the paper are:

> a tree, a ring, a dimensional order, a set of clusters, or some other kind of configuration

Structures are the instances of a specific form. Searching for the best structure means finding the best instance of the form that represents the data. An example given in the paper is:

> Biologists have long agreed that tree structures are useful for organizing living kinds but continue to debate which tree is bestâ€”for instance, are crocodiles better grouped with lizards and snakes or with birds (8)?

# Algorithm

To find the best structure that explains the data ( maximize P(S, F|D) ), search through every form and find the best structure for each form. The final structure is the best structure overall. 

Begin with all entities in a single cluster node and use graph grammars to split 
entities into multiple cluster nodes.
At every split, entities in original cluster node  must be distributed between
the 2 new cluster nodes.
2 entities are randomly chosen and 1 is placed in each of the new cluster nodes.
The rest of the entities are selected randomly and placed greedily in a cluster node.

During each iteration, each cluster node is split multiple times, and the 
split that improves the score the most is accepted.

"Chunk" appears to be a term from cognitive psychology. Essentially a class. If correct, function organizes data into classes.

Example of a chunk:

    }
    friend {
      name Jenny
      likes f34
    }

Has an `if 0` statement. Unclear of purpose (should never be true).
Chooses a head and a tail based on the type of structure. 

### Source
> `function [graph, head, tail, used] = growgraph(graph, head, tail, used, lc, lcprop)`

Inserts a node in the graph depending on the type of structure. Currently unimplemented for tree structures.
Appears that `used` is a bool vector representing whether or not the corresponding element has been placed in the graph.

Only applies for rings. If the tail and the head are not connected, connects them.

Appears to have something to do with tensor product for graphs. Given 2 graphs, creates a new graph composed of all combinations of each graph's vertices. E.g. (A,B,C) x (1,2,3) = (A1,A2,A3; B1,... C3)
Unclear why they used the tensor product with the identity matrix. Would only create block matrices along the diagonal.

Calculates priors for each structure. i represents a specific structure.

 2. chain
 3. ring
 4. unrooted tree
 5. hierarchy unrooted

Unsure what this does. The only difference between this function and optimizebranches is this function has `ps.fast = 1`, whereas optimizebranches has `ps.fast = 0`. Maybe there was an error in the code:

    [currprob graph]= optimizebranches(graph, data, ps);
    if ps.speed == 5
      [currprob graph]= graphscorenoopt(graph, data, ps); 
    end

Maybe this was supposed to be if/else. That would mean that this function sets a flag to approximate the scores instead of making exact calculations.

Splits a node using graph grammars and puts PART1 and PART2 in the children. Not sure what PART1 and PART2 appear to be entities, but this doesn't make sense, because entities are assigned in add_element.m.

Attempts to improve score by swapping objects within the graph. 
Uses Hessian to calculate score and optimizes based on that.
